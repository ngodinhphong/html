            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared form roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant.<br>
            The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Reunion in the Indian Ocean.<br>
            The plan was exported from Africa to countries around the word,<br>
            Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa.<br>
            The two most commonly grown are arabica and robusta.<br>
            Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried.<br>
            Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.<br>
            Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.
